## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-11-17 | Project codename: Aurora | Connection to Eos (goddess of dawn), symbolizes new beginnings and opening gates to brighter perspective |
| 2025-11-17 | Rejected dating app concept | Network effect problem insurmountable for solo developer; positive news app more feasible |
| 2025-11-17 | Considered "Happybara" branding | Charming but potentially too cutesy; "Eunoia" rejected due to phonetic similarity to "annoying" |

---

## Alternative Ideas Considered

### Application Names/Branding
- **Happybara** - Wordplay on capybara, cute and coexist metaphor
- **Eunoia** - "Beautiful thinking" in Greek, but sounds like "annoying"
- Other Greek mythology options: Euphrosyne, Eleos, Astraea, Iris

### Application Concepts (Rejected)
- **Dating app focused on transparency and long-term relationships**
  - Rejected due to: network effect challenges, high user acquisition costs, complex trust & safety requirements

---

## Notes & Observations

- Developer has ~4 years .NET professional experience
- Beginner-level mobile development experience (some Android learning)
- Prefers Greek mythology references
- Target is general audience, not enterprise/professional focus
- MVP approach: Start simple, iterate based on validation
