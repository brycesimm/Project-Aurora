# 🌅 Welcome to Aurora Beta Testing

Thank you for helping test Aurora! This app is my attempt to create a contrasting and new perspective on media distribution by prioritizing positive and uplifting content over negative/fear-mongering counterparts which are common via traditional media distributors. Your feedback over the next 1-2 weeks will help me understand if this concept truly resonates - and where I can improve.

**🤔 What does "beta" mean?** Beta software is a work-in-progress version that's functional but incomplete. Think of it like taste-testing a recipe before it's finalized - the core idea is there, but some ingredients might be missing or rough around the edges.

## 📱 What is Aurora?

Aurora is a mobile app that delivers **curated uplifting news stories** directly to your phone. Instead of algorithms designed to maximize outrage and engagement, Aurora prioritizes stories that highlight human kindness, scientific breakthroughs, environmental progress, and social victories.

**✨ What you'll experience:**

- **✨ Vibe of the Day:** One featured story each day that stands out for its impact or inspiration.
- **📰 Daily Picks:** A scrollable feed of 5-10 additional uplifting stories, each with a short summary and a link to read the full article.
- **💜 Uplift Button:** A simple "like" system to let me know which stories resonate with you (counts are shared across all users).
- **🔗 Share Stories:** Easily share stories that moved you with friends and family.
- **📖 Read Full Articles:** Tap READ to open the complete story in your browser.

The goal is simple: **Give you a daily dose of hope for humanity.** ☀️ If it works, you'll feel more optimistic about the world. If it doesn't, your feedback will help me understand why.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Please Read Before Installing!)

Aurora is in early beta, so please set your expectations accordingly:

### 📱 Platform & Device Support
- **Android-only for now:** iOS development requires a Mac computer and an iPhone for testing, which I don't currently own. If Aurora proves valuable during beta testing, iOS support will be a priority. 🍎

### 📅 Content Updates
- **Manual curation:** New stories are hand-picked by me, formatted into a content file, and uploaded to cloud storage. The app checks for new content when it launches, but **doesn't auto-refresh** while running.
- **Update frequency:** Expect new stories at least once per week; best-case scenario is a new set of content every day. 📰
- **No pull-to-refresh yet:** To see new content after it's been uploaded, close and reopen the app. 🔄

### 🔓 Article Accessibility
- **Goal: Free articles only:** I'm working to curate only articles that don't require subscriptions or payment to read. However, some paywalls may slip through (publishers sometimes change their policies, or I might miss a soft paywall during curation).
- **If you hit a paywall:** Please mention it in your weekly survey or email me the story title. This helps me avoid that source in the future or find alternative links. Your feedback is critical for improving content quality. 💬

### 💜 Uplift Button Behavior (Known Issues)
- **Counts may appear stale at first:** When you open the app, Uplift (like) counts are loaded from the content file (which may be hours old). The **first time you tap the Uplift button** on any story, it syncs with the live database and shows the real count. This is a known technical limitation we're tracking.
- **You can Uplift multiple times:** There's currently no tracking to prevent you from tapping the same story's Uplift button repeatedly. In a future update, each user will only be able to Uplift once per story. 🔒

### 🎯 Minimal Features (By Design)
This beta intentionally focuses on the core concept: *"Can curated positive news make you feel more hopeful?"*

**What's NOT included yet:**
- User accounts or login 👤
- Personalization or filtering by topic 🎨
- Comments or community features 💬
- Dark mode refinements (it works, but may have contrast issues) 🌙
- Search or archive of past stories 🔍
- Much, much more! ✨

If you find yourself wishing for these features, that's valuable feedback! Please mention it in your weekly survey.

## ✅ You'll Know Aurora is Working If...

Despite the limitations above, Aurora should work smoothly for its core functionality. Here's what normal, expected behavior looks like:

- **Stories load when you open the app** (may take 2-3 seconds on first launch while cloud resources spin up)
- **READ buttons open articles** in your phone's browser
- **Uplift counts increase when you tap the button** (the number might jump significantly on your first tap as it syncs with the live database - this is normal!)
- **Tapping Share opens your phone's share menu** with the story title and link pre-filled
- **The "Share Feedback" button at the bottom of Daily Picks** opens the weekly survey in your browser

If something behaves differently than described above, that's worth reporting via the bug template below.

## 📲 Installation

Getting started is simple:

1. **📊 Fill out the baseline survey** (~3 minutes)
   This helps me understand your current media habits and what "positivity" means to you.
   👉 [Baseline Survey](https://forms.gle/eRq3qY1EveJbP6Q87)

2. **⏰ Wait for your Google Play opt-in link**
   After you complete the baseline survey, I will manually send you the opt-in link via the contact method you specified in the form (email or Discord).

   - **📧 Look for an email from:** themetanoiasociety@gmail.com
   - **⏳ If it's been more than 24 hours** and you haven't received anything, please email me at the address above - your message might have been caught in spam, or I may have missed it.

3. **⬇️ Install Aurora from Google Play**
   Tap the opt-in link on your Android device, accept the invitation to join Internal Testing, then install from the Google Play Store.

   **✅ You'll know you have the right app if you see:**

4. **🚀 Open the app and explore!**
   - **⏱️ First launch may take 2-3 seconds** while cloud resources spin up (this is normal for budget hosting during beta)

  **📱 How to find your device info** (needed for bug reports):

  1. Open **Settings** ⚙️ on your phone

## 🎯 What We're Testing

I'm focused on three core questions:

1. **✨ Content Quality:** Do the stories genuinely uplift you, or do they feel forced, cheesy, etc.?
2. **🖱️ User Experience:** Is the app intuitive and pleasant to use (as barebones as it is), or does it frustrate you?
3. **💡 Value Proposition:** Does Aurora make you feel more hopeful about humanity? Would you keep using it after this test if development continued to implement more feedback?

This isn't just about finding bugs 🐛 (though those are helpful!) - it's about discovering whether Aurora delivers on its promise to be a refuge from negativity.

---

## ⏰ Time Commitment

I'm asking for **5-10 minutes at a time throughout the week** for **1-2 weeks**:
- 📱 Daily: Browse stories, tap Uplift/READ buttons (~5 min)
- 📋 Weekly: Fill out the feedback survey whenever works for you during the week (~5-10 min)

**Used it twice or ten times this week? Either way, fill out the survey.** 💬 Any feedback is good feedback, even if you barely used the app - understanding *why* you didn't engage is the most important question for me to answer.

No pressure to use the app if you're not feeling it - honest feedback about why it didn't resonate is just as valuable as glowing reviews. 💯

Thank you for being part of this journey. 🌅 Your input will shape whether Aurora becomes something truly meaningful or needs a substantial rethink. Either outcome is valuable - I just need your truth. ✨
