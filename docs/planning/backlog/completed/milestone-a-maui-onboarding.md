## Feature A-01: Application Shell & Mock Feed
*This feature covers the creation of the basic UI shell and the display of mock data to represent the core home screen experience.*

- [x] **Story A-01.1:** As a user, I want a basic application shell so that I can see the app's title and main content area.
    - **AC 1:** The application window/page displays "Project Aurora" as the title.
    - **AC 2:** The shell provides a designated, styled content area for the main page's content.
- [x] **Story A-01.2:** As a user, I want to see a "Vibe of the Day" hero card on the main page to view the featured story.
    - **AC 1:** A visually distinct "hero" card is displayed at the top of the main page.
    - **AC 2:** The card contains a mock title and a short paragraph of mock text.
    - **AC 3:** A placeholder for an image is included within the card.
- [x] **Story A-01.3:** As a user, I want to see a list of mock "Daily Picks" so I can scroll through uplifting stories.
    - **AC 1:** A scrollable list is displayed below the "Vibe of the Day" card.
    - **AC 2:** The list contains 5-10 mock story items.
    - **AC 3:** Each item in the list displays a mock title and a short text snippet.
- [x] **Story A-01.4:** As a user, I want to see a placeholder reaction button on each story to understand how I will interact with content.
    - **AC 1:** A button with a label (e.g., "Uplift") is visible on the Vibe card and on each Daily Pick item.
    - **AC 2:** The button's click action is not required to be functional for this story.
